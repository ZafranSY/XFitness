> A member named Aina opens the XFitness app.
> The home screen shows her membership expires in 5 days, workout streak (8 days), and “Renew Now” button.
> She taps “Renew”, pays via FPX, gets instant confirmation, and receives a push + email receipt.
> Later that day, she enters the gym — her face scan logs automatically sync to `/access-logs` in the app.
> She views her streak growing and feels rewarded → higher retention.
