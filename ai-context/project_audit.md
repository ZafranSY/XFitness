# XFitness Project Audit (2025-10-19)

## 1. Issue Diagnosed: Navigation Crash

-   **Error:** `A navigator cannot contain multiple 'Screen' components with the same name (found duplicate screen named 'members')`
-   **Root Cause:** Conflict between Expo Router's file-based routing and explicit `Tabs.Screen` definition in `app/(main)/_layout.tsx`. The directory `app/(main)/members/` implicitly created a route named `members`, which clashed with the explicitly defined `<Tabs.Screen name="members" ... />`.
-   **Status:** Resolved.

## 2. Fix Applied

-   **File Modified:** `app/(main)/_layout.tsx`
-   **Change:** Renamed the `name` prop of the Members tab screen from `"members"` to `"memberPages"`.
-   **File System Change:** Renamed the directory `app/(main)/members/` to `app/(main)/memberPages/`.
-   **Rationale:** This aligns the explicit tab definition with the renamed directory structure, removing the name collision while preserving the user-facing tab label "Members".

## 3. Dependency Analysis

-   **Expo SDK:** 54.0.13 (Confirmed via `package.json`)
-   **Expo Router:** ~6.0.11 (Confirmed via `package.json`)
-   **React Navigation:** Dependencies (`@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`, `@react-navigation/elements`, `@react-navigation/native`) are compatible versions for Expo SDK 54.
-   **State Management:** `zustand` ^5.0.8 is present.
-   **Core Dependencies:** `react`, `react-native`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-screens`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated` versions align with Expo SDK 54 requirements.
-   **Status:** All major dependencies appear compatible. No immediate blockers identified.

## 4. Configuration Notes

-   **Typed Routes:** Enabled (`experiments.typedRoutes: true` in `app.json`). Code should leverage generated types for navigation.
-   **React Compiler:** Enabled (`experiments.reactCompiler: true` in `app.json`). Monitor for any unexpected behavior or performance changes.
-   **Fabric:** Enabled (`newArchEnabled: true` in `app.json`). Ensure compatibility testing, especially with UI libraries and animations.
-   **Android Edge-to-Edge:** Enabled (`android.edgeToEdgeEnabled: true` in `app.json`). Verify UI adapts correctly to screen edges.

## 5. Next Steps / Recommendations

1.  **Verify Fix:** Run `npx expo start -c` to ensure the navigation error is resolved.
2.  **Test Navigation:** Thoroughly test navigation to and between all tabs, especially the "Members" tab and its child screens (`memberPages/index.tsx`, `memberPages/[id].tsx`).
3.  **Review Typed Routes:** Update any `router.push` or `Link` usages to use the typed routes generated by Expo Router for better type safety.
4.  **Implement Supabase:** Begin replacing mock data and hooks (like `useMockAuth`) with actual Supabase integration.
